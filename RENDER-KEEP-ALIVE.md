# 🚀 Render Keep-Alive System

This document explains how to keep your TaskVIP backend active on Render's free tier using GitHub Actions.

## 📋 Problem

Render's free tier automatically spins down web services after **15 minutes of inactivity**. This causes:
- Cold start delays when users access your app
- Potential timeout issues
- Poor user experience

## 💡 Solution

We've implemented an automated keep-alive system using GitHub Actions that:
- Pings your backend every **14 minutes** (before the 15-minute timeout)
- Uses multiple health check strategies
- Provides detailed logging and monitoring
- Requires zero maintenance once set up

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Your Render Backend URL

You have two options:

#### Option A: Using GitHub Secrets (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `RENDER_BACKEND_URL`
5. Value: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` (replace with your actual Render URL)

#### Option B: Edit the Workflow File
1. Open `.github/workflows/keep-render-alive.yml`
2. Replace `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` with your actual Render URL

### Step 2: Get Your Render URL

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Copy the URL (it looks like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`)

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. If prompted, enable GitHub Actions for your repository

### Step 4: Test the Workflow

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Keep Render Backend Alive" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow** to test manually
4. Check the logs to ensure it's working

## 📊 Workflow Features

### Basic Keep-Alive (`keep-render-alive.yml`)
- Simple health check every 14 minutes
- Basic error logging
- Lightweight and reliable

### Advanced Keep-Alive (`advanced-keep-alive.yml`)
- Multiple wake-up strategies
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- Retry mechanisms
- Better error handling

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Look for green checkmarks ✅ (success) or red X ❌ (failure)
3. Click on any run to see detailed logs

### Workflow Logs Show:
- ✅ Backend health status
- 🚀 Wake-up attempts (if needed)
- 📊 Execution summaries
- ⏰ Next scheduled ping time

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Workflow Not Running
- **Cause**: GitHub Actions not enabled
- **Solution**: Go to Actions tab and enable workflows

#### 2. 404 Errors
- **Cause**: Wrong backend URL
- **Solution**: Check your Render URL and update the secret/workflow

#### 3. Timeout Errors
- **Cause**: Backend taking too long to respond
- **Solution**: Check your Render service logs for issues

#### 4. Authentication Errors
- **Cause**: Backend requires authentication
- **Solution**: Health endpoint should be public (no auth required)

### Debug Steps

1. **Manual Test**: Try accessing `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health` in your browser
2. **Check Render Logs**: Look at your Render service logs for errors
3. **Verify Workflow**: Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow has the correct URL
4. **Test Locally**: Run the health check script locally

## 📈 Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ Faster response times (no cold starts)
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Consistent availability

### For Developers
- ✅ Automated maintenance
- ✅ Detailed monitoring
- ✅ Zero ongoing costs
- ✅ Easy to set up and forget

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- Render free tier has limited hours per month
- Keep-alive will use more of your allocated hours
- Monitor your usage in Render dashboard

### GitHub Actions Limits
- GitHub provides 2,000 free Action minutes per month
- Each ping uses ~1 minute
- 14-minute intervals = ~3,000 pings/month
- You may need to optimize for heavy usage

### Optimization Tips
- Use the basic workflow for minimal resource usage
- Consider increasing interval to 13 minutes if needed
- Monitor both Render and GitHub usage

## 🔄 Workflow Schedule

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/14 * * * *'  # Every 14 minutes
```

This runs:
- **Daily**: 102 times (24 hours × 60 minutes ÷ 14 minutes)
- **Monthly**: ~3,060 times
- **GitHub Minutes Used**: ~3,060 minutes/month

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Your keep-alive system is working when you see:
- ✅ Green checkmarks in GitHub Actions
- 🚀 Consistent response times from your app
- 📊 "Backend is alive!" messages in workflow logs
- ⏰ No cold start delays when accessing your app

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review GitHub Actions logs
3. Verify your Render service is running
4. Test the health endpoint manually
