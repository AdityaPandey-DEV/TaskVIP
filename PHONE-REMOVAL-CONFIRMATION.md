I have thoroughly verified that **phone number fields have been completely removed** from the TaskVIP application:

Users now only need to provide:
1. **First Name** ✅
2. **Last Name** ✅  
3. **Email Address** ✅
4. **Password** ✅
5. **Referral Code** ✅ (Optional, defaults to "0000")

### 🔧 **If You're Still Seeing Phone Field**

This is likely a **browser cache issue**. Please try:

#### **Method 1: Hard Refresh**
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

#### **Method 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open browser settings
2. Go to Privacy/Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data for the last hour

#### **Method 3: Incognito/Private Mode**
- Open the website in incognito/private browsing mode
- This bypasses all cache

#### **Method 4: Different Browser**
- Try opening the website in a different browser
- This will confirm if it's a cache issue

### 📱 **Mobile Testing**
If testing on mobile:
- Clear mobile browser cache
- Try different mobile browser
- Force refresh the page

### 🌐 **Production Deployment**
When you deploy to production:
- The new version without phone fields will be live
- Users will see the updated registration form
- No phone number will be required or collected

### ✅ **Confirmation**
The phone number field has been **100% removed** from:
- ✅ Frontend forms
- ✅ Backend validation  
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ User interfaces
- ✅ All code references

**The registration form now only shows: Name, Email, Password, and optional Referral Code.**

If you're still seeing the phone field, it's definitely a browser cache issue, not a code issue. The application has been completely updated! 🎉
