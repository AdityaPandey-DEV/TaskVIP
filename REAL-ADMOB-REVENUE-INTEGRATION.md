# üí∞ Real AdMob Revenue Integration Guide

## üéØ Current Status vs Goal

### What You Have Now:
- ‚ùå Mock video player (no real ads)
- ‚ùå Demo experience (no revenue)
- ‚ùå Simulated AdMob interface

### What You Want:
- ‚úÖ Real AdMob ads from Google
- ‚úÖ Actual revenue generation
- ‚úÖ Real advertisers paying you money

## üîß Steps to Get Real Revenue-Generating AdMob Ads

### 1. AdMob Account Setup & Approval

**Current Status:** You have AdMob account with IDs
**Next Step:** Get your app/website approved by Google

```
Your AdMob IDs:
- App ID: ca-app-pub-1881146103066218~5156611105
- Ad Unit ID: ca-app-pub-1881146103066218/5022532125
```

**Requirements for Approval:**
- Real traffic (not just test users)
- Quality content and user experience
- Compliance with AdMob policies
- Active user engagement

### 2. Implement Google AdMob SDK

**Current:** Custom video player simulation
**Needed:** Real Google AdMob SDK integration

```javascript
// Real AdMob SDK Implementation
import { AdMob } from '@capacitor-community/admob';

// Initialize real AdMob
await AdMob.initialize({
  requestTrackingAuthorization: true,
  testingDevices: ['YOUR_DEVICE_ID'],
  initializeForTesting: true, // Remove for production
});

// Load real rewarded video ad
const options = {
  adId: 'ca-app-pub-1881146103066218/5022532125',
  isTesting: false, // Set to false for real ads
};

await AdMob.prepareRewardVideoAd(options);
await AdMob.showRewardVideoAd();
```

### 3. Web-Based AdMob Integration (For Your Website)

**For web apps like yours, use Google AdSense with AdMob:**

```html
<!-- Real AdMob Web Integration -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1881146103066218"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- Rewarded Video Ad -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1881146103066218"
     data-ad-slot="5022532125"
     data-ad-format="rewarded"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

### 4. Revenue Requirements

**To start earning money:**

1. **Traffic Requirements:**
   - Minimum 1000+ daily active users

   - High completion rates for video ads

3. **Google Approval:**
   - Your app/website must be approved by Google
   - Compliance with AdMob policies
   - No invalid traffic or click fraud

### 5. Expected Revenue

**Realistic Revenue Expectations:**
- **CPM (Cost Per Mille):** $0.50 - $5.00 per 1000 views
