# 🔍 Website Verification Guide for Ad Networks

## 🎯 **Issue: Verifying task-vip.vercel.app**

You're trying to verify your website with an ad network (PropellerAds/Adsterra) but getting a verification error because the `sw.js` file needs to be in the correct location.

## 📁 **Understanding Root Directory for Vercel/Next.js**

### **For Next.js on Vercel:**
- **Root directory** = `public/` folder in your project
- **Files in `public/`** are served directly from your domain root
- **Example:** `public/sw.js` becomes `https://task-vip.vercel.app/sw.js`

---

## 🔧 **Solution: Add Verification File**

### **Step 1: Download the sw.js File**
1. **From the ad network dashboard:** Download the `sw.js` file they provided
2. **Save it** to your computer (don't rename it)

### **Step 2: Add to Your Project**
1. **Navigate to:** `frontend/public/` folder in your TaskVIP project
2. **Copy the `sw.js` file** into the `public/` folder
3. **File structure should look like:**
   ```
   frontend/
   ├── public/
   │   ├── favicon.png
   │   └── sw.js          ← Add this file here
   ├── app/
   ├── package.json
   └── ...
   ```

### **Step 3: Deploy the Changes**
```bash
# Commit and push the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add ad network verification file sw.js"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Wait for Deployment**
1. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** (takes 1-2 minutes)
2. **Check deployment status** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Verify file is accessible:** Visit `https://task-vip.vercel.app/sw.js`
4. **You should see** the verification file content

### **Step 5: Complete Verification**
1. **Go back to the ad network dashboard**
2. **Click "Verify" button** again
3. **Should now show:** ✅ Verified

## 🛠️ **Alternative Method: Manual File Addition**

If you don't have the project locally, you can add the file through GitHub:

### **Step 1: GitHub Web Interface**
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/AdityaPandey-DEV/TaskVIP
2. **Navigate to:** `frontend/public/` folder
3. **Click:** "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. **Upload:** the `sw.js` file
5. **Commit:** with message "Add verification file"

### **Step 2: Automatic Deployment**
1. **Vercel will auto-deploy** from GitHub
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment
3. **Test:** `https://task-vip.vercel.app/sw.js`
4. **Verify:** in ad network dashboard

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Verification Issues**

### **Common Problems:**

#### **1. File Not Found (404)**
**Cause:** File not in correct location
**Solution:** Ensure `sw.js` is in `frontend/public/` folder

#### **2. Verification Still Failing**
**Cause:** Deployment not complete or cached
**Solutions:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for full deployment
- Clear browser cache
- Try verification again
- Check file is accessible at URL

#### **3. Wrong File Content**
**Cause:** Downloaded wrong file or corrupted
**Solution:** Re-download verification file from ad network

#### **4. Domain Not Matching**
**Cause:** Verification file for different domain
**Solution:** Ensure you're verifying `task-vip.vercel.app` specifically
